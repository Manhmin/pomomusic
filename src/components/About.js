                            What is the Pomodoro Technique?

                        <p className={paragraph}>
                            The Pomodoro Technique was developed in the late
                            1980s by then university student Francesco Cirillo.
                            Cirillo was struggling to focus on his studies and
                            complete assignments. Feeling overwhelmed, he asked
                            himself to commit to just 10 minutes of focused
                            study time. Encouraged by the challenge, he found a
                            tomato (pomodoro in Italian) shaped kitchen timer,
                            and the Pomodoro technique was born. Though Cirillo
                            went on to write a 130-page book about the method,
                            its biggest strength is its simplicity:
